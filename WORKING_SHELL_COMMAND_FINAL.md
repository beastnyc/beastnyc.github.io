# âœ… WORKING SHELL COMMAND - Final Solution

## **Your Working Shell Command:**

**Command Name:** `Push Working Notes`

**Working Directory:** (leave empty)

**Shell Command:**
```bash
/bin/bash -c "cd '/Users/bianca/Working Notes' && cp -r '/Users/bianca/Documents/mind/_notes'/* '_notes/' && /usr/local/bin/npm run build && /usr/bin/git add . && /usr/bin/git commit -m 'Update notes from Obsidian' && /usr/bin/git push origin main"
```

## **What This Does:**
1. **Changes to Working Notes directory**
2. **Copies your Obsidian notes** to the `_notes` folder
3. **Builds the site** with npm
4. **Adds all changes** to git
5. **Commits with message** "Update notes from Obsidian"
6. **Pushes to GitHub**

## **Your Workflow:**

3. **Changes automatically sync and deploy** to your website

## **Test It:**
