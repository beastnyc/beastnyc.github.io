Knowledge work should accumulate insights over time, but most knowledge workers don't have systems that support this accumulation.

The typical pattern is to start fresh with each new projectâ€”reading papers, taking notes, then moving on without building lasting understanding. This is incredibly wasteful.

## Building cumulative knowledge systems

Effective knowledge workers develop systems that help insights accumulate:

- **[[Evergreen Notes]]:** Persistent, developing insights
- **Regular review:** [[spaced-repetition]] for ideas
- **Connection-making:** Linking ideas across projects and domains
- **External thinking:** Using writing to extend cognition

The goal is to build a "knowledge asset" that grows more valuable over time, rather than starting from zero with each new project.

## The compound interest of learning

Just as compound interest makes money grow exponentially, cumulative knowledge systems can make learning grow exponentially. Each new insight builds on previous insights, creating powerful feedback loops.

This principle underlies why effective [[deep-work]] is so important for knowledge workers.
