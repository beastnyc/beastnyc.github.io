Evergreen notes are written and organized to accumulate over time. Unlike most notes apps, the goal here isn't to collect information: it's to develop insights.

Most people take only transient notes. That is, they write temporary reminders and scratch thoughts that they'll use once then abandon. But [[Knowledge Work]] can be much more effective when we accumulate insights over time.

## Properties of evergreen notes

Effective evergreen notes share several properties:

- **Atomic:** Each note should be about one thing. This makes them easier to link and helps avoid orphaned ideas.
- **Concept-oriented:** Notes should be organized around concepts, not projects, people, or sources.
- **Densely linked:** The real insight comes from the connections between ideas.
- **Own words:** Writing in your own words forces you to really understand the concept.

The term "evergreen" comes from the idea that these notes, like evergreen trees, remain useful and "alive" throughout the seasons.
