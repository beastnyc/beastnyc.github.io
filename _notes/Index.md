Welcome to my digital garden of interconnected thoughts and ideas. This is where I explore concepts, build knowledge, and share insights that accumulate over time.

**ðŸ§ª Test Update - September 17, 2025** - Testing the automation pipeline from Obsidian to website.

**âœ… Second Test** - Testing the simplified workflow after fixing exit code 2 error.

**ðŸš€ Third Test** - Testing the completely rewritten simple workflow.

**ðŸŽ¯ FINAL TEST** - Testing complete automation with package.json build script fix!

**ðŸ’¯ ULTIMATE TEST** - Testing with package.json in _notes for Vercel deployment!

[[Here]] you'll find my collection of evergreen notes - ideas that grow and evolve through connections and iterations. Each note represents a building block in my understanding of the world. Check out my work on [[Multipotentiality]] too

## What You'll Find Here

- **[[Evergreen Notes]]**: Ideas that develop and mature over time
- **[[Knowledge Connections]]**: Links between concepts across domains
- **Personal Insights**: My evolving understanding of various topics
- **Learning Journey**: The process of building cumulative knowledge

## About This Space

This digital garden follows the principles of evergreen note-taking, inspired by Andy Matuschak's approach. The goal isn't just to collect information, but to develop insights that compound over time.

Every note here is designed to be:
- **Atomic**: Focused on one core concept
- **Connected**: Linked to related ideas
- **Evolving**: Updated as understanding deepens
- **Useful**: Practical for future thinking and writing
