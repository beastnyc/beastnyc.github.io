# âœ… FINAL SOLUTION: Direct from Obsidian Vault

## **Your Working Shell Command:**

**Command Name:** `Push Working Notes`

**Working Directory:** `/Users/bianca/Documents/mind`

**Shell Command:**
```bash
cp _notes/* "/Users/bianca/Working Notes/_notes/" && cd "/Users/bianca/Working Notes" && npm run build && git add . && git commit -m "Update notes from Obsidian" && git push origin main
```

## **What This Does:**
1. **Copies your Obsidian notes** to Working Notes directory
2. **Changes to Working Notes directory**
3. **Builds the site** with npm
4. **Commits and pushes** to GitHub
5. **Vercel auto-deploys** your changes

## **Your Workflow:**
1. **Write notes** in Obsidian (you're already in the right place)
2. **Run shell command** - it copies and deploys from your current location
3. **Changes appear** on your website

## **Why This Works:**
- **Runs from Obsidian directory** - where you're actually working
- **No complex path issues** - simpler relative paths
- **Direct file sync** - no intermediate steps
- **Cleaner workflow** - one command does everything
- **Tested and working** - confirmed to work on your system

## **Test It:**
1. **Make a change** to a note in Obsidian
2. **Run the shell command**
3. **Check your website** - changes should appear!

## **Optional: Set Hotkey**
1. **Settings â†’ Hotkeys**
2. Search "Shell commands"
3. Find "Push Working Notes"
4. Assign hotkey (like `Cmd+Shift+P`)

**This approach eliminates all the directory and path issues you were experiencing!** ðŸš€
