# ðŸ”§ Direct Command Fix for Obsidian Shell Commands

## **The Problem:**
"env no such file in directory" - Obsidian can't find the `env` command or has issues with script files.

## **The Solution: Use Direct Command**

Instead of using a script file, use this direct command in Obsidian Shell Commands plugin:

### **Option 1: Simple Direct Command**
```bash
cd "/Users/bianca/Working Notes" && npm run build && git add . && git commit -m "Update notes from Obsidian" && git push origin main
```

### **Option 2: With Absolute Paths (Most Reliable)**
```bash
cd "/Users/bianca/Working Notes" && /usr/local/bin/npm run build && /usr/bin/git add . && /usr/bin/git commit -m "Update notes from Obsidian" && /usr/bin/git push origin main
```

### **Option 3: With Timestamp**
```bash
cd "/Users/bianca/Working Notes" && /usr/local/bin/npm run build && /usr/bin/git add . && /usr/bin/git commit -m "Update notes from Obsidian - $(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')" && /usr/bin/git push origin main
```

## **How to Set This Up:**

1. **Open Obsidian**
2. **Settings â†’ Shell commands**
3. **Add shell command**
4. **Command name:** `Push Working Notes`
5. **Shell command:** Use one of the options above
6. **Working directory:** Leave empty

## **Why This Fixes the Issue:**

- **No script files** = No shebang/env issues
- **Direct execution** = No file path problems
- **Inline commands** = Everything runs in one shell session

## **Test Command (Use This First):**
```bash
cd "/Users/bianca/Working Notes" && pwd && echo "Directory changed successfully"
```

This will verify that the basic directory change works.

## **If You Still Get Errors:**

Try this diagnostic command:
```bash
/bin/bash -c "cd '/Users/bianca/Working Notes' && pwd && which npm && which git"
```

This will show you exactly what's available in Obsidian's environment.

**The direct command approach should completely eliminate the env/file issues!** âœ…
